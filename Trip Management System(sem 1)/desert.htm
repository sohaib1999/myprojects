 <h2>Evening Desert Safari</h2>
<h3>Dubai Desert Safari : Tour Description</h3>

<p>A traditional Dubai Desert Safari begins with a pick-up from your hotel. Be sure to wear loose fitting and comfortable desert safari outfit in order to be more comfortable on your trip. Your highly skilled and licensed Desert Safari Guide/Driver will pick you up from your hotel lobby and take you to a location only 30 kilometers from the Oman Border. It takes around 1 hour 20 mins to reach the first and most important stop in this adventure.</p>

<p>This stop will be right before entering the desert, which allows guests to loosen up and stretch after the long ride. The main motive for stopping here is to reduce the tire pressure of the Desert Safari 4×4 Dubai Land Cruisers from 35 psi to 10 psi. This is done to increase the traction of the tire and preparing it for the soft sand later. After all the preparations are made, you will be taken into the desert at the designated meeting point for our convoy. This is where guests can try sand boarding (not available in the summer due to the extreme heat). Next all the desert safari cruisers will start and move together in a line.</p>

 <h3>Dune Bashing :</h3>

<p>Tighten your seat belts cause this is where the fun begins.

<p> Experience a heart pumping adrenaline filled ride while conquering the sand dunes. “Conquering the dunes” is apt as your highly skilled Desert Safari guides will make it seem like nothing. That’s mainly due to the fact that they are skilled professionals. The whole convoy follows the squad leader (with a small flag on top of their Cruiser), who is generally the most experienced and knows the desert well.</p>

<p>Around 20 mins into the ride the convoy will halt for a short while to cool of the engines. This is the perfect opportunity to click those memorable selfies and panoramic images of the desert. Make sure to get a photo with the falcons that are carried around by locals at this point.</p>

<p>After this 15-minute stop, its time to exit the desert and go towards our Lavish Desert Camp where our diligent  crew are franticly working to make your camp experience as delightful as possible. As the picturesque desert turns mellow orange from the setting sun, you will reach our desert camp. A much welcome site for weary travellers.</p>

 <h3>At the Camp:</h3>

<p>Once at the camp, you will be greeted with warm smiles and much needed complimentary snacks and beverages. After refreshing yourself and resting for a while, head to the Quad Biking area just outside the Camp. A Quad Bike is 4 wheel petrol powered bike which is very well adapted to the desert terrain. After racing around in your quad bike, make sure to try the complimentary camel ride available beside the Quad Bike area. These gentle creatures are considered the ship of the desert. In the 1800’s the local Bedouin tribes used camels to travel across the desert in search of food, water and pasture.</p>

<h3>Evening Live Entertainment and Dinner:</h3>

<p>Once you are done with quad biking, it is time to sit and enjoy a pleasant Buffet Dinner with live Traditional Tanoura Dance performance followed by a mesmerizing Belly Dance show. The buffet Dinner will have international cuisine from BBQ Platter to traditional Arabic cuisine like homus, fatoush, lamb kabab etc. You can also enjoy the complimentary Shisha.</p>

<p>Make sure to try out the traditional Kandura dresses for men and Abaya for women. These are kept in the Majlis area. You can also try out our complimentary henna painting in this area.</p>


<p>Our camp is also one of the few camps in Dubai with licensed bar at the camp site, so feel free to check it out. The rates are nominal and soft drinks and water are free of cost.</p>

<p>Around 8:30 in the evening it will be time to say good by to the desert camp and furthermore head back to your hotel. Make sure to pick up your belongings and  head over to the 4×4 cruisers waiting for you outside the camp.</p>

<p>All good things must come to an end, but you will definitely carry fond memories of an unforgettable adventure.</p>
