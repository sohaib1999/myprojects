<p>
Stunning Varkala beach lies around one hour north of capital Trivandrum in Kerala, and provides a relatively peaceful alternative to the now commercialized Kovalam. The setting of this beach is striking enough to take your breath away, with a long paved stretch of cliff bordered by shacks and views that extend over the Arabian Sea. It's an excellent place to rest and rejuvenate, with yoga and Ayurveda being popular there.

<img src=" marinedrive.jpg" alt=" "/></td><td><p>

Marine Drive is a 3.6-kilometre-long boulevard in South Mumbai in the city of Mumbai. The road was constructed by late philanthropist Bhagojisheth Keer & Pallonji Mistry. It is a 'C'-shaped six-lane concrete road along the coast, which is a natural bay. The road links Nariman Point to Babulnath and Malabar Hill. Marine Drive is situated over reclaimed land facing west-south-west. A promenade lies parallel to this road. Marine Drive is also known as the Queen's Necklace because, if viewed at night from an elevated point anywhere along the drive, the street lights resemble a string of pearls in a necklace.

<img src=" kovalam.jpg" alt=" "/></td><td><p>
The most developed of Kerala's beaches, Kovalam is located not far from Trivandrum. It's made up of two coves -- Hawa (also referred to as Eve's beach) and Lighthouse. Lighthouse is the biggest and busiest of the two, with its promenade lined with open air restaurants. The lighthouse atop this beach provides fantastic views, especially at sunset. If you'd prefer somewhere a little more secluded, you'll find nearby Samudra beach to be a better option. Kovalam is also one of the best beaches in India for surfing.
